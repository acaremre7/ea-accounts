Account creation API made for Blue Harvest

Test Description

Blue Harvest Backend Code Assessment
The assessment consists of an API to be used for opening secondary current accounts of
already existent customers.
The API will expose an endpoint which accepts the user information (customerID,
initialCredit).
Once the endpoint is called, a new account will be opened connected to the user whose ID
is customerID.
Also, if initialCredit is not 0, a transaction will be sent to the new account.
Another Endpoint will output the user information showing Name, Surname, balance, and
transactions of the accounts.
Feel free to use any open source tool.
For storing the information, the data can be saved in memory and not actually persisted, so
that we can test the solution easier.
The expected deliverable is source code and instructions on how to execute it.
The programming language by default is Java but we are flexible if you let us know which
other language you prefer.
Bonus:
Accounts and Transactions are different services.
Bonus:
Frontend (simple one will be fine).
Testability will be also assessed.
