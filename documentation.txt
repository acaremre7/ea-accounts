Usage //
///////

On the main page, you'll need to press "Initialize Data" first to create some dummy accounts. Then you can see all customers on the main page, and click on any of them to see their details and make some actions.

When you click to a customer, you'll see customer's details, which satisfies the following criteria of the assignment:
"Another Endpoint will output the user information showing Name, Surname, balance, and
transactions of the accounts."

Under "Open New Account" title, you can click on "Create Account" to create an empty account on the selected customer, or you can set Initial Credit textbox before you click the button to set an initial credit of the account you'll about to create, which satisfies the following criterias of the assignment:
"The API will expose an endpoint which accepts the user information (customerID,
initialCredit).Once the endpoint is called, a new account will be opened connected to the user whose ID
is customerID.
Also, if initialCredit is not 0, a transaction will be sent to the new account."
